# Introduction
The application of deep nueral network in solving partial differential equation attracts tons of attentions nowaday. The most inportant advantage of DNN 
approach is to tackle the curse of dimentionality. Compared to regular numerical method, FD FV and FE for example, DNN approach does not require presetting 
the mesh grid of the computational domain; in fact, the data set is randomly sampled. In this project i will apply this approach to some interesting system.
# The error function and optimization methods

# Numerical examples
In this part, we consider following examples.
## Transport equation with zero b.c
Consider 1d transport equation f_t + v f_x = 0. The constraints consist of two parts: IC and PDE. Here 
we solve the transport equation by two ways: continuous time method and discrete time method. The main difference between these two methods is whether take time varibale t as input of NN.
