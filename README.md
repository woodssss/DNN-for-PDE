# Introduction
The application of deep nueral network in solving partial differential equation attracts tons of attentions nowaday. The most inportant advantage of DNN 
approach is to tackle the curse of dimentionality. Compared to regular numerical method, FD FV and FE for example, DNN approach does not require presetting 
the mesh grid of the computational domain; in fact, the data set is randomly sampled. In this project i will implement this approach by Keras.
# The error function and optimization methods

# Numerical examples
In this part, we consider following examples.
